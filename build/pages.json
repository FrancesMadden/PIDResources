They mention the other facets which would have had to have been implemented in order to implement that facet.<\/p>\r\n<p>Compatible PID types are included where the facet describes an externally facing aspect of implementation.<\/p><\/div>\r\n<h3>The Baseline<\/h3>\r\n<p>Identifiers assigned within the metadata for physical items and\/or digital objects. The identifiers are not globally unique, machine readable or resolvable. This is where we assume most users of this resource will be and the various facets build on this.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Explanation<\/h4>\r\n<p>This is what most organisations use now. These could be accession numbers, archive reference number, barcodes, internal database identifiers. The identifiers might be used in different systems but there is no computer interaction between systems using the identifier.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Benefits<\/h4>\r\n<p>You can use them to find items within your collection, however often they only work across one type of collection, e.g. you cannot search the museum collection management system using the archive reference number. Internal reporting is possible.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Example<\/h4>\r\n<p>Any museum with a collection management system such Adlib, TMS, Emu etc. will meet this requirement. Archives using a management system such as Calm. Libraries using a system such as Aleph or Alma.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk\/research\/research-centre\/archive\/record\/NG1\">\r\n\t\t<img style=\"position:relative;width:400px;\" src=\"graphics\/ng archive eg.png\">\r\n\t<\/a><\/center><\/br>\r\n<p>[https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk\/research\/research-centre\/archive\/record\/NG1|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk\/research\/research-centre\/archive\/record\/NG1]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/nhm.primo.exlibrisgroup.com\/permalink\/44NHM_INST\/1afpmgq\/alma9924331902081\">\r\n\t\t<img style=\"position:relative;width:400px;\" src=\"graphics\/nhm eg.png\">\r\n\t<\/a>\r\n<\/center>\r\n<\/br>\r\n<p>[https:\/\/nhm.primo.exlibrisgroup.com\/permalink\/44NHM_INST\/1afpmgq\/alma9924331902081|https:\/\/nhm.primo.exlibrisgroup.com\/permalink\/44NHM_INST\/1afpmgq\/alma9924331902081]<\/p>",
